# Seminar on Causal Inference

This code is part of my work at the seminar on causal inference at the University of Munich, supervised by Prof. Daniel Wilhelm.

It is based on Blandhol et al. (2022): *When is TSLS actually LATE*.

The codes are used to generate coefficients as shown in the presentation and the term paper.
